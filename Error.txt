The issue is because react-native-google-mobile-ads is not compatible with Expo. As per the official documentation:

"This module contains custom native code which is NOT supported by Expo Go"

More info here

Another easy way to fix the problem is to execute a build with:

npx expo run:android

After that, you can use expo normally
